Multinationals under the spotlight
{: .h1 .text-white .cpb2}

This platform provides unprecedented insights into  how large corporations approach taxes across borders. Explore 
country-by-country financial reports published by multinationals to see where they declare profits and revenues, 
identify potential uses of tax havens or loopholes and analyze tax payments versus actual operations.<br/><br/>
While some multinationals now publish detailed country data, the reports remain scattered and difficult to analyze 
collectively. Our tool compiles this information into an accessible, user-friendly format. Start exploring the tax 
footprints of major multinationals today and unlock key insights into an often opaque aspect of global business.

The Great Tax Escape
{: .h2 .text-white .text-weight500 .cpb4 .cpr10 }

Exploiting loopholes, multinationals funneled over $1 trillion in profits to tax havens in 2022 alone. This 
industrial-scale tax avoidance costs countries 10 % of their corporate tax base annually undermining their ability to 
fund vital public services for citizens

The Call for Tax Transparency
{: .h2 .text-white .text-weight500 .cpb4 .cpr10 }

Investors, activists, and governments demand transparency - are corporations paying their fair share ? But too often, 
the data trail goes cold. Country-by-Country Reporting makes corporate tax strategies more transparent, one company at 
a time.

Tracking the Tax Trail
{: .h2 .text-white .text-weight500 .cpb4 .cpr10 }

While more companies voluntarily publish their country-by-country tax reports, an incoming EU directive will force 
thousands of multinationals to disclose their global tax footprints.<br/>
The catch ? No central database is mandated, making monitoring difficult. This site aims to be that missing public 
repository.
